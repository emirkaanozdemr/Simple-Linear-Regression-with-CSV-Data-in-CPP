# Simple-Linear-Regression-with-CSV-Data-in-CPP
This project demonstrates how to perform a simple linear regression using C++ and the Eigen library. The project involves reading data from a CSV file, creating matrices for independent (X) and dependent (y) variables, computing the regression coefficients, and making predictions for new data points.
